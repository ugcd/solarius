## TODO

* Create functions to export results from the polygenic analysis to CSV tables.
    * covariates: Estimate, SE, p-value (including mean)
    * h2r: random effects (all three h2r, c2 and e2), kurtosis, variance due to covariates, #individuals
* Parse the value of kurtosis (computed for residuals), the number of individuals in an analysis.
* Fix the polygenic analysis with `screen` argument.
* Guess the chromosomes; check out on parallel computing

## Done 

* Update DESCRIPTION and R code to switch from Depends to Imports.
* Work on the residuals from the polygenic model. See documentation on 
  `polygenic` SOLAR comand (`-residinor` option).
* Make `dat50` SNP data available in plink format.
