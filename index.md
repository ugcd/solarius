### About

This web page is about R package `solarius` developed in the [UCGD](http://ugcd.github.io/) research group,
Institute of Biomedical Research of Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.
The package provides an interface to [SOLAR](http://www.txbiomed.org/departments/genetics/genetics-detail?r=37):
*Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines* program,
which in turn has been designed
in the [Department of Genetics](http://www.txbiomed.org/departments/genetics) of Texas Biomedical Research Institute.

The idea of `solarius` is simple. Do calculus in `SOLAR` at back-end. Make user interface in `R` at front-end. That is.
<s>Too little science here.</s>
